# Recipe-Management-System
A Recipe management system is designed to assist with common kitchen tasks. They can be utilized during cooking steps, but they cannot cook on their own. Instead, this website can assist in cooking steps ranging from ingredients preparation (cutting, steaming, mixing etc.) to appropriate time and temperature management.
